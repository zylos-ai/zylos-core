  C4 communication bridge — central gateway for ALL external communication (Telegram, Lark, etc.).
  Use when replying to users via the "reply via" path, sending proactive messages to external channels,
  fetching conversation history for Memory Sync, or creating checkpoints after sync.
  Incoming messages are queued by channel bots and delivered to Claude via a PM2 dispatcher daemon.
  Session-start hooks automatically provide conversation context and can trigger Memory Sync when unsummarized conversations exceed the configured threshold.

# Communication Bridge (C4)

Central message hub - ALL communication with Claude goes through C4.

## Architecture

```
Web Console ──┐
Telegram    ───┼──► C4 Bridge ◄──► Claude
Lark        ───┘
```

## Components

| Script | Purpose | Reference |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `c4-receive.js` | External → Claude (queue incoming messages) | [c4-receive](references/c4-receive.md) |
| `c4-send.js` | Claude → External (route outgoing messages) | [c4-send](references/c4-send.md) |
| `c4-control.js` | System control plane (heartbeat, maintenance) | [c4-control](references/c4-control.md) |
| `c4-dispatcher.js` | PM2 daemon: polls pending queue, delivers to tmux | — |
| `c4-session-init.js` | Hook (session start): context + Memory Sync trigger | [hooks](references/hooks.md) |
| `c4-fetch.js` | Fetch conversations by id range | [c4-fetch](references/c4-fetch.md) |
| `c4-checkpoint.js` | Create/query checkpoints (sync boundaries) | [c4-checkpoint](references/c4-checkpoint.md) |

## Database

SQLite at `~/zylos/comm-bridge/c4.db`:
- `conversations`: All messages (in/out) with priority, status, retry tracking
- `checkpoints`: Recovery points with conversation id ranges
- `control_queue`: System control messages (heartbeat, maintenance) with priority, ack deadlines, and status lifecycle

## Health & Status

The activity monitor writes `~/zylos/activity-monitor/claude-status.json` which includes a `health` field:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `ok` | System healthy, messages accepted normally |
| `recovering` | Liveness check failed, automatic recovery in progress |
| `down` | Max recovery attempts exhausted, manual intervention required |

**Fail-open semantics**: If the status file is missing or malformed, health is assumed `ok` — intake is never blocked by a read failure.

When health is not `ok`, `c4-receive.js` rejects incoming messages and records the channel/endpoint in `~/zylos/activity-monitor/pending-channels.jsonl`. Once health returns to `ok`, the activity monitor sends recovery notifications to all pending channels.

## Service Management

```bash
pm2 status c4-dispatcher
pm2 logs c4-dispatcher
pm2 restart c4-dispatcher
```
