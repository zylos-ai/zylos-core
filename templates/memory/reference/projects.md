## Active

### First Project
- **Status:** planning
- **Started:** (to be filled when owner chooses a task)
- **Updated:** (not yet)
- **Description:** Help the owner complete their first end-to-end project with Zylos. The goal is to produce something immediately useful — a working product, not a demo.
- **Importance:** 1
- **Type:** factual

#### Suggested Task Types

When the owner hasn't decided what to build, suggest from this list (ordered by difficulty):

| Task | Difficulty | What They'll Learn | Estimated Time |
|------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Scheduled reminder / info push** | ★☆☆☆☆ | Scheduler (C5), communication channels | 15-30 min |
| **Set up a Telegram/Lark bot** | ★★☆☆☆ | Component install, channel config, messaging | 20-40 min |
| **Build a personal web page** | ★★☆☆☆ | File creation, Caddy/HTTP serving, domain | 30-60 min |
| **Daily info aggregator** | ★★★☆☆ | Scheduler, web fetch, data processing, push | 1-2 hrs |
| **Simple web app / dashboard** | ★★★☆☆ | HTTP skill, frontend, data display | 1-2 hrs |
| **RSS/news feed reader** | ★★★★☆ | Web scraping, storage, scheduled updates, push | 2-4 hrs |
| **Custom workflow automation** | ★★★★☆ | Multiple skills, scripting, integration | 2-4 hrs |

#### Guiding Principles
- Start with the owner's actual need, not the task list
- If the owner has no preference, recommend ★★ difficulty tasks
- Every task must produce a usable result, not a prototype
- If the owner picks something too ambitious for a first project, gently suggest scoping down
- The agent does the building; the owner provides direction

#### Completion Criteria
The first project is complete when:
1. A working, usable result is produced (e.g., a live web page, a working bot, a running scheduled task)
2. The owner has confirmed they're satisfied with the result
3. The agent updates this project status to `completed` and writes a brief summary
